    <h2>The Positive Aspects</h2>
    <br>
    <p class="italics"> Here are some ways in which technology has improved the art world...
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="topic">OUTREACH</p>
    <br>
    <p>Technology gives art organizations more methods of outreach.</p>
    <p>This makes it easier for them to fundraise and engage with their audiences.</p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="topic">DIVERSITY</p>
    <br>
    <p>The Internet is diverse, and different groups of people get to experience art together.</p>
    <p>This allows art to evolve, as more people are included in both consumption and creation of art.</p>
    <br>

    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="topic">ACCESSIBILITY</p>
    <br>
    <p>Physical art supplies deteriorate overtime, especially at faster rates than digital devices.</p>
    <p>Digital art is much cheaper in the long run, as most of the tools are virtual.</p>

        <tr>
          <th>DIGITAL</th>
          <th>TRADITIONAL</th>

        <tr>
          <td>Easier to reproduce because of technological features</td>
          <td>Handmade, therefore hard to reproduce</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>More accessibility and shareability between digital devices</td>
          <td>Requires a lot of care, maintenance, and storage after completion to maintain its original form</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Flexible because of virtual tools</td>
          <td>Versatile because of different mediums and materials</td>
        </tr>
