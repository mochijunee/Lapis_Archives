<!-- Commented description on how I made my website: 
I originally had the idea to make a website about mental health awareness for teenagers, but I was unsatisifed
with the way it looked when I coded it out. I changed my topic to technology and art because I saw a lot of
free images online that were relevant to this topic and aesthetically pleasing. 

I started researching the relationship between technology and art because I was curious to see the impact of 
rising technology and social media. This laid out a lot of the groundwork for creating the website. I found
resources and information and then started coding page by page. 

Because the CSS for each page is pretty much the same, I put all the CSS in one file. I worked on this project
independently and gathered inspiration from the previous website I scrapped (my original idea).
